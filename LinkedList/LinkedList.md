Linked Lists:
* Each node in a Linked List contains data and a pointer that points to the next node (or null if there are no more nodes)
* Grow and shrink as necessary, making them a 'Perfect Fit' in memory
* Only allocate memory when we add add an item to the list, so each node can end up living in a different area of memory
* You can add to the beginning, middle (sorted), or end of list
* Order is important, you can lose data in the list if your pointers are incorrect
* Slow to access information (You cannot search by index, you need to traverse the list item by item)
